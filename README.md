# Data Structures in TypeScript

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Description

This repository is dedicated to practicing data structures in TypeScript. It provides an opportunity to learn and implement various data structures commonly used in software development. By practicing data structures, you can enhance your understanding of algorithms, improve problem-solving skills, and gain confidence in writing efficient code.

## Installation

Before getting started, ensure that you have Node.js version 20 or above installed on your system. If you don't have Node.js, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the tests for all data structures, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

You can also pass an optional partial folder name to run tests for specific data structures. For example:

```bash
npm test stack
```

To create a new data structure, run the following command:

```bash
npm run add <name-of-data-structure>
```

This command will create a folder with the specified data structure name under the `src` directory. It will include the necessary files, such as the implementation file and a test file. The class representing the data structure will be exported from the implementation file and imported into the test file for easy testing and validation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have solutions or implementations for the data structures in different programming languages, feel free to add them to the `solutions` folder. Create a folder for the language of your choice and include your solution files there. This can be a valuable resource for others who might be stuck or want to compare implementations.

Please ensure that your contributions follow the established coding conventions and maintain consistency with the existing codebase.

## Acknowledgments

This repository draws inspiration from the Primeagens course on Frontend Masters, which provided valuable guidance and insights into data structures and their implementation. Their expertise and teaching have greatly contributed to the creation of this repository.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out. Happy learning and practicing!
